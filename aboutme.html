<h1>About James</h1>
    <p>My personal carrer goal in life is to become an engineer in a field of computer science, robotics, or civil engineering which ever I can make the largest impact in. I plan to take the engineering and computer courses while being invovled in skills usa and working outside of class on wrestling and activites with recruiters to go to the Air Force Academy to recive an education in engineering to work for our counrty. I choose this path in life becuase I am passionate about engineering and belive it's a way to help others while having a financial job in what i excel at but mostly to making family happy and proud.<p/>
<p>A strong characteristic i have is my ambition in wrestling as i strive high and work for what i want looking to accomplish the task my best and in coding i belive it is important to have ambition in your work. I am also reliable in school when a group needs something done look to me or with a question even to wrestling if our team needs a pin i will get it done. One of my major accomplishments in life is when i took second at cadet state and was invited on the  california national team where i went to national duals and individuals while meeting diffrent college coaches opening oppurtunities.Also when i was choosen for student of the month met many political people and was awarded a student athlete award felt accomplished because i got something that wasan't sports related knowing i am versitile. <p/>
<p>I have participated in many activites such as school wrestling, club wrestling, spikeball club, club soccer, national team soccer, robotics, Skills USA, FCA club, rockclimbing, fishing, hunting, and hiking. From experience i have learned that i am a leader through leading clubs,helping teammates, and being a friend. Showing me how i'm a natural leader in how I present myself in words, actions, and carry myslef demonstrating how i handle critical leading situations. Through working in physical labor work I have seen my determination in a task to dig or pull I was determined to accomplish my task efficently no matter the difficulty of the cirumstance or suffering.
