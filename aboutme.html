<h1>About James</h1>
    <p>My personal career goal in life is to become an engineer in a field of computer science, robotics, or civil engineering which ever I can make the largest impact in. I plan to take the engineering and computer courses while being involved in skills USA and working outside of class on wrestling and activities with recruiters to go to the Air Force Academy to receive an education in engineering to work for our country. I choose this path in life because I am passionate about engineering and believe it's a way to help others while having a financial job in what I excel at but mostly to making family happy and proud.</p>
<p>A strong characteristic I have is my ambition in wrestling as I strive high and work for what I want looking to accomplish the task my best and in coding i believe it is important to have ambition in your work. I am also reliable in school when a group needs something done look to me or with a question even to wrestling if our team needs a pin I will get it done. One of my major accomplishments in life is when I took second at cadet state and was invited on the California national team where I went to national duals and individuals while meeting different college coaches opening opportunities.Also, when I was choosen for student of the month met many political people and was awarded a student athlete award felt accomplished because I got something that was not sports related knowing I am versatile </p>
<p>I have participated in many activities such as school Wrestling, Club Wrestling, Spike ball Club, Club Soccer, National Team Soccer, robotics, Skills USA, FCA Club, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, and hiking. From experience I have learned that I am a leader through leading clubs, helping teammates, and being a friend.

Through working in physical labor work I have seen my determination in a task to dig or pull I was determined to accomplish my task efficiently no matter the difficulty of the circumstance or suffering. In conclusion, I believe I have valuable traits, strengths, and achievements to help me succeed thank you for your time and ask you to visit rest of my site.</p>
